# hyperledger-iot-registry

## Purpose

The purpose of this application is to come up with a potential use case of hyperledger fabric and exercise our skills as developers to create a MVP of such a use case.

## Use Case

Imagine a consortium between a major parking authority (e.g., Green P) and car rental companies (e.g., Hertz and Rent-A-Car) that share and exchange data on the parking lots and rented cars to better optimize their subsequent business models. The data is collected by smart parking IOT sensors [like this one here](https://www.bosch-connectivity.com/products/connected-mobility/parking-lot-sensor/) and IOT devices that collect data from rental cars.
